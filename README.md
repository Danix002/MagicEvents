# MagicEvents - italiamagicevents.it

## Project Overview
**MagicEvents** is an interactive event management platform designed to enhance participant engagement through personalized digital services. Originally conceived as a [university project](https://github.com/Danix002/Advanced-Software-Development-Architecture-Technologies-Project), this application has evolved into a personal development initiative aimed at bridging the gap between event organization and real-time social interaction.

## Key Features
The application allows organizers to enable multiple modular services tailored to the specific needs of an event:

* **Interactive Digital Canvas:** A dedicated space for participants to share real-time messages, dedications, and notes.
* **Collaborative Media Gallery:** A centralized section for attendees to upload and share photos, creating a collective visual memory of the event.
* **MagicEvents AI Game:** An interactive guest-guessing game inspired by the "Akinator" logic, designed to foster engagement among participants.

## Project Status
The application is currently in the **active development phase**.
